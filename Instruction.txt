Introduction :

The main scope of this project is to measure the temperature of a closed
environment lets say we want to measure the temperature of a room.

Basically a range is fixed that is,the minimum and maximum temerature values are fixed
and if the measured vaule is not in this range then the system alarms and sends a notification 
to the users device through SMS, email, telegram etc.
